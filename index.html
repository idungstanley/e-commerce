                        <p class="p-1">This canopy net is just what I was looking for! I wanted one that would keep mosquitoes out and yet look fancy and this is it. It was pretty simple to put up. I like the overlaps because it certainly keeps unwanted insects out. It reaches all the way to the floor, but at night, I like tuck the bottom a bit under the mattress.</p>

                        <p>Beautiful! I can see through it, which I like. I also bought some magnets, as the seems droop down without them. I got some gold ribbon to tie each corner, which I like a lot better than the white strings that came with it.</p>
